    # reach the region that the chest sits in.
    # However, our two enemies work differently.
    # Entering the room with the enemy is not enough, you also need to have enough combat items to be able to defeat it.
    # So, we need to set requirements on the Locations themselves.
    # Since combat is a bit more complicated, we'll use this chance to cover some advanced access rule concepts.

    # Sometimes, you may want to have different rules depending on the player's chosen options.
    # There is a wrong way to do this, and a right way to do this. Let's do the wrong way first.

    # Now, what's actually wrong with this? It works perfectly fine, right?
    # If hard mode disabled, Sword is enough. If hard mode is enabled, we also need a Shield or a Health Upgrade.
    # The access rule we just wrote does this correctly, so what's the problem?
    # The problem is performance.
    # Most of your world code doesn't need to be perfectly performant, since it just runs once per slot.
    # However, access rules in particular are by far the hottest code path in Archipelago.
    # An access rule will potentially be called thousands or even millions of times over the course of one generation.
    # As a result, access rules are the one place where it's really worth putting in some effort to optimize.
    # What's the performance problem here?
    # Every time our access rule is called, it has to evaluate whether world.options.hard_mode is True or False.
    # Wouldn't it be better if in easy mode, the access rule only checked for Sword to begin with?
    # Wouldn't it also be better if in hard mode, it already knew it had to check Shield and Health Upgrade as well?
    # Well, we can achieve this by doing the "if world.options.hard_mode" check outside the set_rule call,
    # and instead having two *different* set_rule calls depending on which case we're in.

    # In our case, it's pretty useful because hard mode and easy mode have different requirements.
